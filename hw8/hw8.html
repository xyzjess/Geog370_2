    <h1>hw 8 What roads are more suseptible to stress in Cary?</h1>
    <h2>Jesse Benedict</h2>
    <h3>In This map I used road and upcoming development data to show what roads are more suseptible to traffic stress. More upcoming developments means more road usuage and might make more roads stressed in sourounding areas. I used the Intersect, Buffer, and Disolve geoprocessing tools to make this map. I used the Disolve tool to combine various developments and roads and then I Put a buffer on the roads and used the Intersct tool to see what roads were around these upcoming developments to get a better visual representation of roads that might be more suseptible to stress. </h3> <br>
